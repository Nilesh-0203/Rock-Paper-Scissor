🎮 Imagine a world where you can engage in a classic game of Rock Paper Scissors right from your web browser! 🌐 That's exactly what I've crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Click on the rock, paper, or scissors icons, challenge the computer, and watch as the game unfolds with vibrant animations.

✨ The user experience is heightened with interactive hover effects, making each move feel dynamic and engaging. The real-time scoreboard keeps track of your wins against the computer, adding an extra layer of excitement to every round.

💡 This project not only showcases my technical skills in web development but also reflects my passion for creating enjoyable and interactive experiences. Ready for a quick game? Head over to the link and let me know your high score! 🚀🕹️ #WebDevelopment #JavaScriptMagic #HTMLCSS #GameDevelopment
